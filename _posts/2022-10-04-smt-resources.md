## Markded/Unchecked resources for learning SMT

- [Decision procedures](http://www.decision-procedures.org/)

This book and associated slides teach how the decision procedure works in the SMT solver for different theories such as bit-vectors or linear real arthimetic

- [SMT-LIBv2 online tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/logic/basiccommands/)

This website gives an online tutorial on how to write SMT-LIBv2 constraints. It seems to cover the same topics as the Python version [Programming Z3](https://theory.stanford.edu/~nikolaj/programmingz3.html#sec-transitive-closure), which I am currently looking at.  

- [Z3Py Guide](https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm)

This website gives more examples on how to use z3 python API to do different things
