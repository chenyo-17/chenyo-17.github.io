## What is SMT-LIBv2

SMT-LIBv2 is a standard for writing SMT constraints, its latest version v2.6 can be found [here](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.6-r2021-05-12.pdf). 

Being a standard means any SMT solver such as [z3](https://github.com/z3prover/z3) should be able to parse and check the SMT constraints complying to this standard.

A simple SMT file has the suffix `.smt` and looks like the following:

```shell
(set-option :produce-models true)
(set-logic QF_LIA) ;; different logics use different theoreies to solve the constraints 

(declare-fun x () Int) ;; declare interger constant
(declare-fun y () Int)

(assert (and (<= (+ x 3) (* 2 y)) (>= (* 2 x) 5)))  ;; adding constraint

(check-sat)
(get-model) ;; if sat, produce an assignment of x and y that satisfies all assertions
```

Input the above file to a SMT solver, and the solver will output the assignments as following, which means `x = 3` and `y = 3` satisfies the assertion.

```shell
sat
(
  (define-fun x () Int
    3)
  (define-fun y () Int
    3)
)
```

If there is no way to satisfy all assertions, the solver will output `unsat`, and then one can query the set of assertions that cannot be satisfied by: 

1. adding `set-option :produce-unsat-cores true` in the beginning; 
2. assign a name to each assertion (i.e. `assert (! (=> P Q) :named PQ)`); and 
3. append `(get unsat-core)` in the end.

## Basic syntax 



## Using z3 solver in Emacs

There exists Emacs package to support `z3-mode`, the github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/zv/z3-mode).

After the successful installation, one should be able to see the syntax highlights for most key words when `z3-mode` is activated, and with `C-c C-c` one could execute the solver and get the result in another buffer.
