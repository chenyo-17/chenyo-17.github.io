### Introduction

This paper formulates the *loop-free* assembly code optimization task as a stochastic search problem.

It encodes the correctness and performance constraints during the code transformation in *cost function* and uses a MCMC sampler to explore the program space to find the optimization given a target program.

Beginning from `llvm -O0` code, this approach can produce programs that match or outperform programs with `O3` compiler optimization and in some cases expert hand-written assembly.
